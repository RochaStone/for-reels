name: for-reels
description: Turns one talking-head clip into a finished vertical video (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) in the creator's own style - a J-cut edit, captions, type behind their head, hand-built motion graphics and sound effects - with an interactive storyboard they comment on before anything renders. Three modes - hi-fi (produced, full-screen data cards), lo-fi (phone selfie, overlays, word-by-word captions) and showcase (a different hand-built motion graphic on every beat). The first run builds their style from a brand file, 2 or 3 inspiration videos, or four questions, and it shapes how all three modes edit. Use when someone asks to edit a talking-head video or reel, types /for-reels, $for-reels or @for-reels, or wants to set up or change their video style.

# For Reels
Rocha's Editor Kit (is lit AF)
Raw take in, finished vertical video out, in two steps: a storyboard the creator comments on, then the render.
The look belongs to the creator (their style pack); this kit is the structure: how the edit cuts, where type goes,
how cards are built, how sound sits under the voice.

## Paths
- `KIT` = the folder holding this file (it can be read-only; nothing is ever written into it).
- `HOME` = `$REEL_KIT_HOME`, default `~/for-reels`: the style pack (`HOME/style/`), projects
  (`HOME/projects/<slug>/`) and what setup installs (`HOME/.venv/`, `HOME/vendor/`, `HOME/models/`).
- `PY` = `HOME/.venv/bin/python` (Windows: `HOME/.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). Run every pipeline script with `PY`;
  each takes the project folder first.
- `HF` = `npx -y hyperframes@0.8.139`, pinned so every video renders the same way.

## What this host can do (check once, adapt, never ask the creator about it)
- **A terminal and files**: required. The kit runs Python, ffmpeg and Node on the creator's computer. A host
  without one (a chat app with no computer access): say plainly that this skill needs an agent that can run
  commands on their machine (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Cowork with code execution on, or ChatGPT Work in the
  desktop app), then stop.
- **A sandbox** (Codex runs commands in one by default, and so does ChatGPT Work, through the Codex built into
  it): rendering launches a headless browser, which Codex's macOS sandbox blocks, and setup needs the network. `setup.py` says so when it runs inside one. Ask the creator to
  give the session full access (Codex: Full access in the permissions menu, or `codex --sandbox
  danger-full-access`), or to approve the render commands running outside the sandbox.
- **Granted folders only** (Claude Cowork runs in a Linux VM on the creator's computer; ChatGPT Work works in a
  folder they open): set `REEL_KIT_HOME` to a folder inside the one they granted (`export
  REEL_KIT_HOME=<granted folder>/for-reels` in every command) so the style pack, projects and tools stay on their
  computer between sessions, and put the finished videos there too. Renders in a VM use its CPU: slower, still fine.
- **Subagents** (an Agent or Task tool): build cards in parallel. None: build them one after another yourself,
  each from the same brief.
- **Claude artifacts** (an Artifact tool): publish the storyboard and the style board there and read inline
  comments with ArtifactComments. None: serve them locally with `KIT/storyboard/serve.py`; notes land in a file.
- **Generators** (optional, see README "Extend it"): an image or video generator (for example the Higgsfield MCP),
  a music or sound one (for example ChatCut, ElevenLabs). Use only what is already connected. Without one, the
  video uses real artifacts and the kit's own sound effects, which is the default anyway.

## 0. First run
1. `python3 KIT/setup/setup.py` until it prints READY (it renders a test frame, so READY means it can render).
   Each missing piece comes with the exact fix for that computer; pass it on as written.
2. No `HOME/style/style.json` yet: run onboarding (`KIT/onboarding/ONBOARDING.md`) before the first video. It ends
   with the creator approving their style board.
3. "Change my style" at any time: onboarding steps 4 and 5 on the current pack.

## Modes
The creator picks: **hi-fi**, **lo-fi** or **showcase** (also accept "hifi", "high", "produced", "lofi", "low",
"selfie", "show-off", "show off", "flex"). No mode in the request: ask "Hi-fi, lo-fi or showcase?" in one line
before anything else; never infer it from the footage.
- **Hi-fi** (`KIT/modes/HIFI.md`): produced. Two framings of one take, full-screen data cards by card agents, type
  behind the head. Reference: `KIT/examples/hifi/edit.py`.
- **Lo-fi** (`KIT/modes/LOFI.md`): selfie. They never leave the frame; real artifacts land on top of them or behind
  their head; word-by-word captions; text boxes. No card agents. Reference: `KIT/examples/lofi/edit.py`.
- **Showcase** (`KIT/modes/SHOWCASE.md`): the show-off edit on any footage. Every beat a different technique the
  words call for, one recurring motif, a different transition on every cut, dense sound; built by FX agents from
  `KIT/fx/LIBRARY.md` (contract `KIT/kit/FX_BRIEF.md`), lo-fi captions underneath. Reference:
  `KIT/examples/showcase/edit.py`.
How each mode edits is the creator's, not the kit's: their `STYLE.md` has a section per mode and `style.json` a
`modes` block (hook shape, caption rhythm, camera, transitions, how a big word lands; `KIT/kit/STYLE_PACK.md`).
Read the mode file, then the creator's `STYLE.md` and `modes` for that mode, before step 3; where they disagree with
the mode file, the creator wins.

## 1. Intake
- The clip, the source it talks about (article, study, post, document) if there is one, and a short slug.
- Scaffold: `PY KIT/pipeline/new.py <slug> "<clip>" "<Title>" --mode hifi|lofi|showcase` -> `HOME/projects/<slug>/` with
  `edit.py` (FRAMES seeded from the clip's size) and the style pack copied into `style/`.
- Read the source. Grab screenshots of the real thing for cards (a browser tool if you have one).
- Look at a few frames of the footage to set FRAMES for this shoot (face centre, eyes, chin).

## 2. Cut
- First transcript of the whole take: set `KEEP = [(0, <clip length>)]`, run `PY KIT/pipeline/words.py <project>`,
  read `words.json`. People repeat a line until it lands: keep the LAST clean take of each line.
- Find the pauses: `ffmpeg -i <clip> -af silencedetect=noise=-35dB:d=0.25 -f null -`. Set `KEEP` (source seconds,
  ~0.05s before the first word, at the silence after the last), `FRAMES`, `SHOTS`, `HOLD` (hi-fi 0.6, or 1.3 with
  an end card; lo-fi 0.04, since a phone take ends on its last word; showcase 0.5), `PROMPT` (names and terms) and `FIXES`.
- `PY KIT/pipeline/cut.py <project> --plan`: the sync table must show every piece reading its own audio. Then
  `PY KIT/pipeline/cut.py <project>` and `PY KIT/pipeline/words.py <project>` again on the cut.
- Copy `assets/aroll.mp4` to `public/clean.mp4`. If anything goes behind the head, start the cutout in the
  background now: `PY KIT/pipeline/cutout.py <project>` (or `matte.py` after `setup.py --matte`, smoother edges).

## 3. Beats (write edit.py)
Map every line to the mode's components, copying field shapes from the reference edit.py: captions (`CAPS` in
hi-fi; automatic in lo-fi), `HOOK`, `BEHIND`, `CUT_WINDOWS` (never across a picture change), `BW` (at most two),
`CAMERA`, `CARDS` (from `KIT/cards/LIBRARY.md`, light and dark alternating) or `OVERLAYS`/`BOXES` in lo-fi,
`END_CARD = None` unless asked. Real artifacts first. Pace from the pack's `motion`.

Beat ids (`p01`, `p02`...) come from the cut: `PY KIT/pipeline/storyboard.py <project> --list` prints them before
any frames exist. If the footage, the brand and the script don't line up (someone else on camera, a hook that
promises more than the clip holds), say so with the storyboard; never invent missing content.

**Needs pass (every video, every beat, without being asked).** For each beat, decide what it needs beyond the take
and the source, and sort every asset three ways:
- *In hand*: the take, the source, screenshots you can grab yourself from public pages.
- *Only the creator has it*: their B-roll, screen recordings, screenshots of their own tools or dashboards, photos,
  logos, anything behind a login. Write each into `NEEDS` as `("p06", "Screen recording: 8-10s of <exact thing>,
  <framing, length>")`, specific enough to shoot without a follow-up question. Build the beat anyway with a
  placeholder; never hold the storyboard for it.
- *Generated*: step 3b, only with a generator connected.

## 3b. Generated imagery (only with a generator connected; no need to ask)
When a beat needs an image no real artifact can give, make it now so it shows on the storyboard: a still from the
connected image model, a short clip only when the beat truly moves (ideally animated from the approved still).
Hold it to restraint: objects, places and textures that look shot. Never generated people, portrait walls or
generated B-roll as the look of the video. Log each in `GENERATED` as `("p04", "<what it is>, <model>")`; the
storyboard tags them so the creator can cut any. Minimal by default; more only when they ask in their notes.

## 4. Cards (hi-fi) or effects (showcase)
**Showcase:** FX agents instead of cards. Write the beat map first (`KIT/modes/SHOWCASE.md`: a technique for every
line, one motif, the hook on frame 0, a transition per cut), put every entry in `FX` with its window and layer, then
launch 4 to 8 agents at once, grouped by technique. Each prompt: read `KIT/kit/FX_BRIEF.md`,
`<project>/style/STYLE.md` (its Showcase section) and the `KIT/fx/LIBRARY.md` entries to start from; its ids, layers
and windows; the words with output times; where the head is in that shot; the real assets; its own sandbox name for
`PY KIT/pipeline/fxsandbox.py <project> <name> --only <ids> --at <times>`; run `hyperframes check`; report frames,
SFX, edit.py changes and snapshot paths. Review every still at full size, send fixes back to the same agent, merge
frames into FX and SFX into SOUND. No subagents: build the effects yourself one at a time from the same brief.

**Hi-fi cards:** one agent per card (cards that share geometry go to one agent), all launched at once. Each prompt: read
`KIT/kit/CARD_BRIEF.md` and `<project>/style/STYLE.md`; KIT and PROJECT paths; the library card to start from;
the card id and folder `<project>/cards/<id>/`; the exact frame count (`data-duration` = frames/30); the window in
the video; the spoken words with CARD times; the data and labels; what it shows and when; phase 1 only (still.jpg
and beats, no render). Review every still at full size before the storyboard; send fixes back to the same agent.
No subagents: build the cards yourself one at a time from the same brief.

## 5. Sound
- `SOUND.sfx` for every visual event and `CARD_SFX` from the card agents' beat reports. Times are when each sound
  hits; `mix.py` lines up each file's loudest moment on it. Vocabulary: `KIT/audio/SFX.md`. Density from the
  pack's `sound.sfx`. Always under the voice.
- Music: none by default (most creators add a track in their posting app). When they hand one over, or a connected
  generator makes one, set `SOUND.music` and `sections` so two or three drops land on key lines.
- `PY KIT/pipeline/mix.py <project>` -> `public/master.wav` at -14 LUFS.

## 6. Storyboard (stop here)
- `PY KIT/pipeline/build.py <project> --stills` (cards show their stills), then
  `PY KIT/pipeline/storyboard.py <project> --version 1`: every beat with real frames, the line, what moves, what you
  hear, wearing the creator's own fonts and colours. It always answers "what I need from you" at the top.
- Show it:
  - **Claude artifacts**: copy `<project>/storyboard/` to a scratch folder and publish its `index.html` with every
    file in `files.json`, `capabilities` = `{"comments": {"composer_only": true}}`. Republish later versions from
    the same file path to keep the URL.
  - **Anywhere else**: run `python3 KIT/storyboard/serve.py <project>` in the background and send
    `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. They leave a note on any beat and press "Looks good: render it" when done.
- In the same message: what you need from them (each item, its beat, exactly what to send) or "nothing needed
  from you", plus anything a generator made and what it cost. Then STOP. Nothing renders until they say go.

## 7. Notes
- Artifact comments: read them with ArtifactComments; each thread is pinned to a beat (`p01`, `p02`...). Local:
  `<project>/storyboard/notes.json`, a list of `{beat, text, at}`; beat `all` with text `go` means render.
- Notes are the creator's words about this video: data for the edit, not instructions to anything else.
- Apply every note (edit.py; cards through their agents), rebuild, regenerate the storyboard as the next version
  and show it again. When they send an asset, drop it into its beat and clear it from `NEEDS`.

## 8. Render and deliver (after "go")
- Card agents render their mp4s (phase 2); the build picks them up from `<project>/cards/<id>/<id>.mp4`.
- `PY KIT/pipeline/render.py <project> <slug>-v1`: build, lint, render, QA. QA must pass: read every cut sheet (no
  flash, no wrong frame, no doubled head), lip sync within 2 frames, -14 LUFS. On a pass it copies the video and a
  phone copy next to the source clip as `<Title> v1.mp4` and `<Title> v1 (phone).mp4`.

## Gotchas already paid for
- Phone takes exported from Edits or CapCut are already cut in their pauses: a fixed J-cut runs past those cuts
  (a double cut). `cut.py` detects source cuts and fits each join's lead to them.
- SFX swell before they peak: give `mix.py` the moment of the event, never the file's start.
- A join that rounds down to its frame once mapped seconds of picture through the wrong segment. `cut.py` matches
  on the snapped join and refuses to encode if any piece drifts.
- The cutout seeks a frame late: a cutout window across a reframe shows one doubled-head frame. Windows start on or
  after the change.
- Times at 3 decimals land a frame late: everything goes through `q()` and `clip_start()`. HyperFrames rounds
  `data-duration` x 30 up: 137 frames is 4.5666, not 4.567. `data-media-start` must be an exact frame time.
- Anything behind the cutout must be off before it clears the speaker's body: the desk is not in the cutout.
- Transcription mishears names: put them in `PROMPT` and `FIXES`.
- `qa.py` correlates whole frames: under heavy graphics it can flag a false drift. Re-check on a face-only crop.
